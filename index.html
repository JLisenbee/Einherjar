          <h3>Pregame Setup</h3>
          <h4>Setting Up the Play Area</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Mark out a 22" x 30" area on a table or other flat play surface. This is the Battlefield</li>
            <li>In that space, place 2-3 Pieces of large terrain preferably with different tiers/floors. Space them out around the play area</li>
            <li>Around the larger pieces of terrain, place 7-10 pieces of scatter terrain. Scatter terrain is terrain consisting of small but useful bits of terrain, such as barricades, boulders, rubble, and the like.</li>
            <p><i>Alternaively, throw the above out and do what ever works for you! Experiment and see how different terrain caters to different strategies or effects the flow of the game!</i></p>
          </ol>
          <h4>Determining Runic Stockpiles</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Divide the Board into 6 sections. Do this by marking out Two 11" x 30" sections, and then dividing each of those into Three 11" by 10" sections as demonstrated <a href="./Setup.png" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li>Each section should be marked semi-permanantly. These sections will be referenced later in the game!</li>
            <li>Label each section 1 through 6.</li>
            <li>Each player takes three Objective Markers (can be anything! Pawns, official markers of some sort, bottle caps, doesn't matter!).</li>
            <li>One player places their three Objective Markers such that there is on in each odd-numbered section, and the other player does the same for each even numbered section.</li>
            <li>Markers can be anywhere in the sections.</li>
            <li>Each objective marker is a Runic Stockpile.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Determining Drop Zones and Deploying Units</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Each Player rolls 1d6.</li>
            <li>The player that rolled higher chooses one of the sections defined during the <i>Determing Runic Stockpiles</i> stage of setup. That section is their Drop Zone.</li>
            <li>The player that rolled lower choose any section to be their Drop Zone that isn't the same section as the first player's Drop Zone and also isn't any one of the sections adjacent to that Section.</li>
            <li>The player that rolled higher then places one of their Units anywhere wholly within their drop zone, then the other player does the same.</li>
            <li>Players alternate back and forth, placing unit in their respective Drop Zones until each player has placed all 5 of their Units.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>The Units and the Paths</h3>
          <h4>The Units</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The Units in Valknut are Soldiers in Spiritually-Powered suits of Exoskeletal Power Armor, known as Runic Armor, that are designed to evolve and change according to wearer's will and the will of the Spirits.</li>
            <li>Each set of Runic Armor is able to manifest a shimmering Spiritual Weapon at will. As such, all Units are always considered to have both a Melee and Ranged weapon on them at any time.</li>
            <li>Each Spirit symbolically represents one of four animals: The Bear, The Deer, The Raven, and the Wolf.</li>
            <li>A skilled warrior, and indeed a skilled Tactician, will leverage the strengths of each Spirit in their Units, both individually and together, to achieve victory.</li>
            <li>Each Unit has the following Game Statistics that represent different things about them and their combat ability:</li>
              <ul>
                <li><u>Hit Points (HP):</u> When a unit takes damage, it's Hit Points will often be reduced. When a Unit's Hit Points are reduced to 0, It is killed and removed from the Battlefield (See <i>Redeploying Units</i> below).</li>
                <li><u>Speed:</u> The number of inches a soldier can move on the battlefield in an activation each time it takes the "Move" action.</li>
                <li><u>Armor:</u> When damage is dealt to a Unit, the damage is dealt to it's Armor first. Armor is restored to it's defined value at the beginning of each turn.</li>
                <li><u>Evasion:</u> The Unit's ability to dodge attacks sent at it. Often Compared to an attackers Accuracy when attacks are made.</li>
                <li><u>Accuracy:</u> How precise a soldier is with it's weapon. Often compared to a defenders Evasion when making an attack.</li>
                <li><u>Damage:</u> How much power is behind the Unit's Spiritual Weapon. When an attack is determined to have hit, this is how much damage an attack will deal.</li>
                <li><u>Actions:</u> How many different things a unit can do in a turn. A list of things a Unit can do is defined below in "Unit Actions".</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
          <h4>Unit Statistics</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>These are the starting values for each of the previously defined Statistics. These will change as the battle progresses, but each Unit starts with these.</li>
            <table>

          <h4>Unit Actions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>All Units have the Following Actions available to them by default: </li>
            <li><u>Move:</u> Move around the board up to a number of inches equal to the unit's movement. Units can climb vertical surfaces, but the distance moved counts as double. Units cannot use the Move action when within 1" of an enemy Unit.</li>
            <li><u>Attack:</u> Make an attack with the Spiritual Weapon (See Below).</li>
            <li><u>Disengage:</u> Unit moves up to 3". This action can only be taken while within 1" of an Enemy Unit.</li>
            <li><u>Pick up Runestone:</u> Unit picks up a Rune Stone from the ground or a Runestone Stockpile. A Unit can only carry one Runestone at a time. While carrying a Runestone, that Runestone moves with the Unit, and it's movement is halved. (Temporary bonuses to movement are not halved, such as from a Raven Spirit. Permanent bonuses, such as those from Steps in Deer, are halved.)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Making an Attack</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><u>Determine Range:</u> Melee attacks can only be made within 1", ranged attacks can only be made when no enemies are within 1". The steps are the same for both, but different bonuses may be applied due to the effects of different Path Boons.</li>
            <li><u>Determine "To-Hit" Number:</u> Compare the Accuracy of the attacker to the Evasion of the Defender. Find the row in the table below that best describes the relationship between the two numbers in the left column. The To-Hit Number is the number in the right column.</li>
            <table>
              <tr>
                <th>Accuracy vs. Evasion</th>
                <th>To-Hit Number</th>

              <tr>
                <td>Accuracy is 2 or more higher than Evasion</td>
                <td>2+</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>Accuracy is equal to Evasion</td>
                <td>4+</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Accuracy 1 less than Evasion</td>
                <td>5+</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Accuracy 2 or more less than Evasion</td>
                <td>6+</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <li><u>Roll to Hit:</u> The attacker rolls 1d6. If the number rolled is greater than or equal to the To-Hit Number, the attack hits. If the attack misses, there is no effect.</li>
            <li><u>Deal Damage:</u> Deal damage to the defender's Armor first, and reduce it by the Damage value of the attacker. If the damage was greater than the defender's remaining Armor, the defender's HP is reduced by the remaining amount.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Life After Death (Redeploying Units)</h4>
          <p>After a unit is killed (see HP above), this is how it is returned to the battlefield.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Remove all bonuses to it's Stats that aren't the fixed bonuses it receives on each step down it's Paths (Armor for Bear, Speed for Deer, etc.)</li>
            <li>If reinforcements have been depleted (See "Winning"), also choose one penalty to apply permanantly: -1 Accuracy, -2" Speed, -1 Damage, -1 Armor. Each can be reduced to a minimum of 0.</li>
            <li>At the beginning of the next turn, roll 1d6. If the result is a 4+, replace that unit on the battlefield.</li>
            <li>If the result was less than 4, continue rolling this way at the beginning of each turn. However, each subsequent roll's target is reduce by 1 until the unit is deployed (3+ the next turn, 2+ the next, and guaranteed the next.)</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>The Paths and Path Boons</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>At the beginning of Each turn, each Unit takes a Step down a Path.</li>
            <li>On each turn, a unit may progress down a Path they have started down, or take the first step down a New Path.</li> 
            <li>Taking a step down a New Path does not reset it's progress down it's previous Paths. Diversity is it's own strength!</li>
            <li>Each step down a Path adds an increase in Statistics, and adds a new ability to that Unit called "Path Boons".</li> 
            <li>The table below describes the bonuses gained at each Path and the various Path Boons.</li>
            <table>

In addition, this Unit's Statistics cannot be forcibly lowered by the Enemy, existing Penalities are not reversed byt this effect. (This ability effects Unit's in the Aura as well).</td>
                <td>Excess damage does not spill over to this Unit's HP after depleting Armor during the "Deal Damage" step (Damage is still taken to HP if no damage was blocked from Armor).
